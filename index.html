    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/karthikk.jpg" height="200">
    <p>Iam Karthikk from India.Iam a very ambitious person, i was working towards a big goal since my graduation in 2018
    but the goal demands even more from me, i was glad to have a supportive family, my parents
never forced me to go for work and encouraged me to prepare for my UPSC exam full-time.
Though my father wants me to prepare 1 more year, though iam confident i can achieve my goal, 
i can see my dad getting older.I made up my mind its time to support my dad, so he can rest and live his life.
Hence i started learning Web Development</p>
